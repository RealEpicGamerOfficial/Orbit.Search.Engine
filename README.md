# Orbit: Internet Search Engine
## About this project
The fastest 'search engine' ever.

Give keywords, then click search to open in Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, or one of the other available options!

NO, this is not a 'search engine', but uses keywords and creates a link for a search engine to use.

### How you search
1. Type Keywords
2. Click Search

### Search Settings
SafeSearch (coming soon, currently built-in and can't be disabled)
Selected Engine (3 Options, more coming soon)
Advanced Search Settings (currently work, menu coming soon)

### Luna AI
Luna is Orbit's AI, At this current time, only a demo is in use.

### Overall Info (and Sales Pitch)
No account needed EVER, and minimum tracking.

Everything is local and is NEVER shared with anyone. 

### Making The Internet Better
We make the internet better by not tracking users or storing their details. 

Google*, your web browser, and your selected search engine may track you online.

*Google, even if not using Chrome, Google, or a Google product, may track you due to the use of fonts in the Google Font library or Google's icons.
